0.2.0 [2010-04-19 11:40 A.M CET]
================================

* **IMPORTANT** database backend: The ``timestamp`` field has been renamed to
  ``sent_at`` as ``TIMESTAMP`` is a reserved word in Oracle databases.

  This means existing users will need to migrate their existing tables.
  In MySQL this can be done manually by using ``ALTER``::

  	ALTER TABLE ghettoq_message CHANGE timestamp sent_at DATETIME;



* Added support for MongoDB.
